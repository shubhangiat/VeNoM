===========
analyse.sh:
===========

USAGE: ./analyse.sh <output file to analyse> <k - number of results (k of top-k)> <n - number of top results wanted (5, 10 etc)> <relative path to utils folder>

Reports degree, chi square and graph structure of answer graphs
Call from the folder where the output file to be analysed is stored, the answer files would be stored in the same folder.


==================
calc_obs_count.sh:
==================

#USAGE: ./calc_obs_count.sh vertex_pair_label "space separated neighbour list of (label,probability) for query vertex" "space separated neighbour list of (label,probability) for input graph vertex"

Calculate observed values of s_0, s_1 and s_2
Calls compute_mat_sym.sh and sum_simlevel.sh, in that order
# label-probability pairs MUST not have any space, list must be passed in quotes


===================
compute_degree2.sh:
===================

#USAGE: ./compute_degree2.sh space separated list of probabilities of neighbouring vertices

Computes degree of each input graph vertex
# label-probability pair MUST not have any space, list must be passed in quotes


==================
compute_degree.sh:
==================

USAGE: compute_degree.sh "space separated list of (label,probability)"

Computes degree of each input graph vertex
# label-probability pair MUST not have any space, list must be passed in quotes


===================
compute_mat_sym.sh:
===================

USAGE: ./compute_mat_sym.sh "space separated list of query triplets" "space separated list of input graph triplets"

Calculate observed values of s_0, s_1 and s_2 for each triplet
# triplets MUST not have any space, list must be passed in quotes


=====================
get_indiv_outputs.sh:
=====================

USAGE: ./get_indiv_outputs.sh

Divide 'output_all' file by the number of query graph searches it has
Call from the folder where you want the answer files


========================
ip_generate_triplets.sh:
========================

USAGE: ./ip_generate_triplets.sh v_label "space separated list of (label,probability)"

Generate triplets with their associated probability for input graph
# label-probability pairs MUST not have any space, list must be passed in quotes


=======================
q_generate_triplets.sh:
=======================

USAGE: ./q_generate_triplets.sh v_label "comma separated list of labels"

Generate triplets for query graph
# list must be passed in quotes


================
sum_simlevel.sh:
================

USAGE: ./sum_simlevel.sh <list of "comma-space separated list of (simlevel,probability)">

Sum up distribution of similarity levels corresponding to each query triplet
# simlevel-probability pairs MUST not have any space, lists must be passed in quotes (simlevel => s0, s1, s2)
